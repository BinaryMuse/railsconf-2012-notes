Didn't take notes during talk due to space. :( Slides will be published later this week.

* Most apps have a main app class, contain views that each contain views
* Use custom pub/sub or backbone router for switching contexts, etc.
* Greenfield approach is difficult, how to handle search engines?
* Sweet spot for Backbone.js is introducing functionality to an already mainly server-side app.
* If creating a brand new app, speaker would recommend looking into other frameworks that use less boilerplate.
